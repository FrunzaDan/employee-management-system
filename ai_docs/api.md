## How it works

### Layering & request pipeline

`WebAPI` (controllers/host) → `BusinessLogic` (services, validation, JWT) → `DataAccess` (ADO.NET + stored procs) → `Domain` (models/config). All employee/employer DB access goes through **stored procedures** — no inline SQL, no ORM. See [database](database.md) for the schema/proc side.

**Middleware order in `Program.cs`** (order matters): `UseExceptionHandler` → `UseCors` → `UseHttpsRedirection` → `UseRateLimiter` → `UseAuthentication` → `UseAuthorization` → `MapGet("/health", ...)` → `MapControllers`. In non-Development environments, `UseHsts()` runs alongside `UseHttpsRedirection`.

- `GET /health` is a bare minimal-API endpoint (not on `EmployeeController`, no `[Authorize]`, doesn't return the `ResponseModel` shape — just a 200) added purely so the Angular UI can poll for API liveness and show an "API is not running" banner instead of the app looking broken (see [angular-frontend](angular-frontend.md)). Being unauthenticated is intentional: it needs to answer even when nobody has a token yet.
- A global exception handler middleware catches any unhandled exception, logs it, and returns a generic `{ Message, Details }` JSON 500 (`Details` only populated in Development) — controllers themselves don't have try/catch blocks.
- CORS is locked to `Cors:AllowedOrigins` in `appsettings.json` (`http`/`https` on `localhost:4206` and `localhost:4206` — 4206 is the port `UI/angular.json` actually serves on; an origin missing from this list shows up in the browser as a CORS block on `/health` and the "API is not running" banner even though the API is up), methods limited to `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE`, headers limited to `Content-Type`/`Authorization`. No `AllowCredentials()` — consistent with bearer-token (not cookie) auth.
- Swagger UI is only wired up in Development, with a Bearer-JWT security scheme so tokens can be pasted in for manual testing.
- `AddRateLimiter` registers one named policy, `"login"`: a per-client-IP fixed-window limiter (5 requests/minute, in-memory), applied via `[EnableRateLimiting("login")]` on just `AuthenticationController.GetAccessToken` — not global, so it never throttles `verify-token` or any `EmployeeController` endpoint. Exceeding it short-circuits with `429` and a small hand-written JSON body, configured via `options.OnRejected` (mirrors the exception handler's `{ Message }` shape rather than going through `ResponseModel`, since this runs before MVC's formatters). In-memory/per-instance, resets on app restart — a deliberate choice for this app's single-instance local/demo scope, not a persistent/distributed solution.

### Controllers

- `AuthenticationController` (`api/Authentication`):
  - `POST /access-token` — body `{ employerId, employerPassword }` → JWT if credentials check out. Rate-limited (see above).
  - `GET /verify-token` — `[Authorize]`-gated; if the request gets past the JWT middleware, the token is valid — the endpoint has nothing left to do but return 200.
- `EmployeeController` (`api/Employee`) — class-level `[Authorize]`, every endpoint requires a bearer token:
  - `POST /register`, `GET /get?searchVariable=...`, `GET /all`, `GET /export`, `GET /auditLog?employeeGuid=...`, `GET /auditLog/all`, `PATCH /edit`, `PATCH /deactivate?employeeGuid=...`, `PATCH /reactivate?employeeGuid=...`, `DELETE /delete?employeeGuid=...`, `DELETE /auditLog/all`.
  - `GET /export` is the one endpoint that doesn't return the uniform `ResponseModel` JSON shape below — on success it returns a raw `text/csv` `File` result instead (see [database](database.md)); on failure it still returns `StatusCode(response.Status, response)` like everything else.
  - `DELETE /auditLog/all` permanently wipes **every** row in `tbl_employee_audit_log` for **every** employee (`usp_deleteAllEmployeeAuditLog` — a plain unconditional `DELETE`, no soft-delete). Wired to a "Clear audit log" button on the global audit log page (`global-audit-log.component.ts`'s `clearAuditLog()`), guarded client-side by a `confirm()` prompt. Carries `[Authorize(Roles = "1801")]` in addition to the class-level `[Authorize]` — a no-op today since `1801` is the only role that exists (see Known gaps below), but it stops a future second role from silently inheriting access to this destructive, untargeted action. The deletion itself is deliberately not audit-logged (no `employee_guid` to attach it to once the table is wiped).

**Uniform response shape:** every mutating stored proc returns a `(result INT, message NVARCHAR)` result set (`result = 0` means success; nonzero mirrors an HTTP status). `DbHelper.HandleResponseWithMessage` reads that into a `ResponseModel<object>`, and every controller action passes it straight through via `StatusCode(response.Status ?? 200, response)` — controllers never branch on status themselves.

### Validation (before a stored procedure is ever called)

- **`EmployeeRegistration`**: rejects missing/invalid `Email` or `Msisdn` (`400`), rejects a missing `Address` (`400` — `usp_createEmployee`'s address parameters have no SQL-side defaults, so a missing address would otherwise surface as an opaque `500` instead of a clean validation error), then always overwrites the GUID server-side (see [database](database.md)).
- **`EmployeeEditing`**: GUID is required and format-validated via `GuidValidation.ValidateGuid` (regex-based, `[GeneratedRegex]`); `Email`/`Msisdn`, if present in the request, are format-validated before the edit is attempted — but unlike registration, they're optional here (partial update). `EmployeeStatus`, if present, is restricted to `Active`/`Test` (same rule as registration) — edit is a partial-update endpoint, not a lifecycle-transition one, so a client can't use it to bypass `DeactivateEmployee`/`ReactivateEmployee`/`DeleteEmployee`'s dedicated audit trail and stored-procedure guardrails.
- **Field length caps**: `FieldLengthConstants` mirrors the `NVARCHAR` lengths declared in the DB schema (`tbl_employees`/`tbl_addresses`). Both `EmployeeRegistration` and `EmployeeEditing` reject an over-length `FirstName`/`LastName`/`Email`, and `AddressValidation.ValidateLengths` (shared by both) checks every address field — without this, an over-length value would either be silently truncated by SQL Server or surface as an opaque error instead of a clean `400`.
- **`Birthdate`/`Gender`**: both registration and editing validate `Birthdate` (must parse via `DateOnly.TryParse` and fit `FieldLengthConstants.Birthdate`, if present) and `Gender` (must be `0`/`1`/`2`, if present).
- Email/MSISDN **uniqueness** is enforced in `usp_createEmployee` (create) and `usp_editEmployee` (edit, excluding the row being edited itself) — `400` if either already exists on another employee. This is a DB-layer check, not duplicated in C#.
- The same regexes exist client-side too, in Angular's `environment.ts` (`EmailRegex`, `PhoneRegex`, `UserName`) — kept in sync **manually**, not shared/generated from one source.
- Validation failures return `400` with a plain message, distinct from the `404`s used for "not found"/"no valid search key" and `409`s used for lifecycle conflicts (see [database](database.md)) — status code choice is meaningful here, not arbitrary.

### JWT auth flow

**Issuing** (`POST /api/Authentication/access-token`):

1. `AuthService.GetAccessToken` rejects empty employer ID/password (`403`), otherwise delegates straight to `JwtCreation.GenerateBearerJwt`.
2. `JwtCreation.GenerateBearerJwt` calls `DbUtils.CheckEmployerCredentialsFromDb`, which fetches the employer's password hash/salt/role via `usp_getEmployerAuthData` and verifies the password (see Password security below). The success response's `Data` carries the employer's role (an `int?`) back up.
3. On success, a JWT is minted: symmetric **HMAC-SHA256** signing (`SymmetricSecurityKey` + `HmacSha256Signature`), key from `Auth:SecureJWTKey` in `appsettings.json` via `JwtSigningKey.Create` (committed value is a demo placeholder — see Known gaps below).
4. **Claims on the token**: `ClaimTypes.Sid` = employer ID, `JwtRegisteredClaimNames.Sub` = employer ID, `ClaimTypes.Name` = employer ID (no separate display name exists yet), `ClaimTypes.Role` = the employer's role fetched in step 2 (empty string if somehow null), `"amr"` = `"pwd"` (authentication-method-reference, OIDC-style — documents _how_ the subject authenticated), `Jti` = random GUID, `Iat` = issue time.
5. Issuer/Audience both `https://localhost:7146/` (demo value), expiry from `Auth:AccessTokenTimeout` (currently `15` minutes).

**Validating** — there is now **one** place tokens are checked, deliberately: `Program.cs`'s `AddJwtBearer` middleware, which runs on every `[Authorize]`-attributed endpoint (all of `EmployeeController`, plus `AuthenticationController.VerifyToken`). It checks signature, issuer, audience, and expiry (`ClockSkew = TimeSpan.Zero`, no grace period), deriving its `IssuerSigningKey` from the same `JwtSigningKey.Create` used at issuing time. `ClaimTypes.Role` is ASP.NET's default role-claim type, so `[Authorize(Roles = "1801")]` works on any endpoint today without touching the JWT pipeline further (used on `DELETE /auditLog/all`, above).

- There used to be a **second**, hand-rolled validation path — a `JwtValidation` class used internally by `AuthService` as a self-check right after minting a token, and an unused `HttpClient` built from an `IHttpClientFactory` that was never actually called with. Both were dead code (request-time auth was always enforced solely by the `AddJwtBearer` middleware) and were deleted; `AuthService` now just checks credentials and returns whatever `JwtCreation` produces (constructor-injected, not manually `new`'d). If you see references to `JwtValidation.cs` elsewhere (older docs, comments), they're stale.
- `JwtCreation.cs` and `Program.cs` used to each independently call `Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(key)` to derive the signing key — two unsynchronized copies of the same logic. Both now go through the single `JwtSigningKey.Create`. The key is still raw ASCII bytes of the configured string, not base64-decoded, despite `SecureJwtKey` looking like base64 — that behavior itself is unchanged, only the duplication was fixed.
- The role claim only reflects the employer's role **at login time** — the token itself isn't re-checked against the DB later, so a role change mid-session only takes effect on the next login (inherent to stateless JWTs, not a bug).

### Password security

- `PasswordHasher.cs`: **PBKDF2-HMACSHA256**, 100,000 iterations, 16-byte random salt, 32-byte hash (`Rfc2898DeriveBytes.Pbkdf2`). Verification uses `CryptographicOperations.FixedTimeEquals` — a constant-time comparison, not `==`, so timing doesn't leak how many leading bytes matched.
- `tbl_employers` stores `employer_password` (BINARY 32, the hash) and `employer_password_salt` (BINARY 16) as **separate columns** — the plaintext password is never stored or logged anywhere.
- `usp_getEmployerAuthData` fetches the hash+salt+role for a employer ID and bumps `last_interaction`; the actual comparison (`PasswordHasher.VerifyPassword`) happens in **C#, not SQL**.
- The seeded demo login (`TestEmployerID` / `Employer123`, see [build-and-run](build-and-run.md)) has its hash+salt precomputed and hardcoded in the post-deployment script's `BINARY` literals.
- This replaced an earlier **unsalted SHA-256** scheme — if unsalted-hash code or a single hash column reappears, that's a regression, not an alternate valid approach.

### Testing (xUnit v3 on .NET 10 SDK)

- The test project covers `BusinessLogic` (validations including `AddressValidation`, `JwtCreation`, `AuthService`, `EmployeeRegistration`/`Editing`/`Getting`/`Activation`/`Deletion`) and `DataAccess`'s `PasswordHasher` — all pure logic, no live DB or Docker needed. This is why `build.sh` runs `dotnet test` _before_ the DB/Docker steps.
- `DbHelper` (stored-proc-result → `ResponseModel` mapping, including the `SqlDataReader`-based row mappers) is **not** unit tested — it takes a concrete `SqlDataReader`, not an interface, so exercising it would need a live connection or a structural change to introduce a mockable seam. Covered indirectly today only by manual testing (Postman/Swagger) and the app actually running.
- Uses `xunit.v3` 4.0.0 (not the older `xunit` v2 meta-package) and `Moq` for mocking `IDbUtils`/`IAppSettingsConfig`.
- The **.NET 10 SDK dropped VSTest support for xUnit v3** entirely — `dotnet test` fails with "Testing with VSTest target is no longer supported..." unless the project opts into the new **Microsoft Testing Platform (MTP)** runner. That opt-in is the repo-root `global.json`.
- That `global.json` is discovered by walking **up from the current working directory** `dotnet` is invoked from — not from the project or `.sln` path — so it has to sit somewhere `dotnet test` will actually be run from or below. `build.sh` runs `dotnet test` from the repo root, hence the file living there.
- This is a **separate, unrelated** `global.json` from `DB/Employee_Management_System_DB/global.json`, which only pins the SQL project's SDK version (`8.0.100`) — the two don't conflict, since discovery stops at the nearest one found walking up from wherever the command runs.
- xUnit v3 test projects compile to a **console executable** (`<OutputType>Exe</OutputType>` in the `.csproj`), not a library — the test assembly is its own runner now, a fundamental v3 architecture change from v2.

## Known gaps / deliberately deferred

Read before assuming something below is an oversight rather than a known, confirmed-with-the-user limitation.

- **`Auth:SecureJWTKey` is a placeholder value** committed in `appsettings.json` — fine for local dev, must be replaced (and pulled out of source control) for any real deployment. Not a live secret to protect; this repo's whole security posture assumes local-only use.
- **No JWT revocation mechanism.** Tokens carry a `Jti` but nothing persists or checks it — a stolen token stays valid until it naturally expires. There's a working client-side logout (see [angular-frontend](angular-frontend.md)), but that's just the client discarding its own copy; a token that already leaked elsewhere (e.g. captured before logout) is still valid until its natural expiry. Deliberate choice, confirmed with the user, over adding server-side revocation (a `Jti` denylist checked per-request) or a refresh-token scheme — both would give up the current fully-stateless design for a bigger architectural change than this app's scope currently justifies.
- **`CheckEmployerCredentialsFromDb`'s role-mismatch branch leaks the employer's numeric role** in its `403` message (`"The provided employer role ({role}) is not valid."`) instead of the generic "Invalid Employer ID or Password." used for a bad password. Low severity (needs already-valid credentials to trigger). Deliberately left as-is — demo-only messaging, not worth the churn of touching it.
- **Single role in practice**: `1801` is the only `employer_role` value currently seeded or checked against (`DbUtils.CheckEmployerCredentialsFromDb` hardcodes the `== 1801` check). The JWT does carry a `ClaimTypes.Role` claim, so per-endpoint `[Authorize(Roles = ...)]` would work if a second role is ever introduced — nothing needs to change in the token pipeline for that, only the DB check and any new `[Authorize]` attributes.
- **Most of `IDbUtils` is still `ResponseModel<object>`** (`RegisterEmployee`, `GetEmployee`, `GetEmployees`, `EditEmployee`, `DeactivateEmployee`, `ReactivateEmployee`, `DeleteEmployee`) — deliberately left that way. None of them are ever cast back to a concrete type in C#: mutating ones carry no `Data` at all, and the read ones (`EmployeeModel`/`List<object>` of `EmployeeModel`) flow straight to JSON serialization in the controller without an intermediate cast. Genericizing all of `IDbUtils` (and `IEmployeeService`, every controller signature, every test mock) to close a risk that doesn't actually exist would be a large, speculative refactor.
- Don't treat this list as a TODO to clear autonomously — several of these (placeholder JWT key, single role, weak `Data` typing, role-message leak, no server-side revocation) are appropriate for a local-learning-project scope and were explicitly confirmed as "leave alone."

**Resolved** (kept for history — don't rediscover these as "new" findings):

- `IDbUtils.CheckEmployerCredentialsFromDb` returning `ResponseModel<object>` cast back to `int?` via `credentialsCheck.Data as int?` — fixed: the interface, `DbUtils`'s implementation, and the call site now use `ResponseModel<int?>` directly.
- No rate limiting or account lockout on `POST /api/Authentication/access-token` — fixed: the `"login"` rate-limiter policy described above.
- `DELETE /api/Employee/auditLog/all` was gated only by the controller's class-level `[Authorize]` — fixed: now also carries `[Authorize(Roles = "1801")]`, see Controllers above.
- The JWT signing key was derived independently in two places — fixed via `JwtSigningKey.Create`, see JWT auth flow above.
- `AuthService`/`JwtCreation` used to be manually `new`'d instead of DI-registered — fixed: both are now properly registered in `BusinessLogicDependencyInjection.cs` (`JwtCreation` as a singleton) and constructor-injected.

## Gotchas / conventions

- Don't add try/catch in controllers — the global exception handler is the intended single place for that.
- `DbHelper.MapEmployeeFromReader` reads `reader["birthDate"]` while the actual column is `birthdate` (lowercase, per `tbl_employees`) — works because `SqlDataReader`'s name lookup is case-insensitive, but it's an inconsistency worth knowing about if this code is ever ported to a case-sensitive reader/provider.
- If you change a regex, remember there are two copies (C# `Validations/`, Angular `environment.ts`) — nothing enforces they match.
- If you change a DB column's `NVARCHAR` length, update the matching constant in `FieldLengthConstants` too — nothing enforces they match either.
- `DbHelper`'s row mappers read nullable string columns via `reader[col] as string`, not `.ToString()` — the latter turns a real `DBNull` into `"DBNull.Value".ToString()`'s empty string instead of surfacing `null`. Keep new nullable-column mappings consistent with this.
